Hiya

I'm Dylan Mortimer.

I'm not sure why I'm writing this, since I'm just a random student, but I'll write it anyway.

I primarily code in Python, but am at a similar skill level for most C-based languages.

I love talking everything computers, so feel free to just talk to me about anything interesting related to computers. Who knows, I might teach you something as well!

Anyways, thanks for reading this.
